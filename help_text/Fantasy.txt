*Parameters must be in order. Those in italics are optional, those underlined are case-sensitive.*



**{prefix}new**: Creates a new fantasy team linked to your discord username.
    *Note: teams are currently linked to your discord username, rather than your id. If you change your username, please contact arco to regain access to your team.*

**{prefix}pick [player] *[slot #]***: Adds a player to your fantasy team, in one of 5 player slots. If no slot is specified, it will automatically fill the first open slot. 
    *Note: If there are no open slots, a slot must be specified to drop and then fill. This uses one transaction. Filling an empty slot doesn't use a transaction.*

**{prefix}drop [slot]**: Empties the given slot of your fantasy team. Uses one transaction.

**{prefix}lb**: Displays the current points leaderboard for fantasy teams.

**{prefix}team *[user]***: Shows the current fantasy team of any fantasy player. Not specifying a player will show your team.

**{prefix}info [player]**: Gives relevant information about a player. '{prefix}info me' will display your own info.

**{prefix}players *[league]* *[limit]* *[pg]***: Shows a leaderboard of players based on fantasy points. Adding 'pg' to the command divides each player's points by the number of series played.
